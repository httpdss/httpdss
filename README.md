### 🚀 About Me

I'm a DevOps engineer with a broad background in IT — from infrastructure and development to management — but over time I realized my true passion lies in the **technical side**. That’s when I decided to double down on DevOps, automation, and infrastructure as code.

What drives me is building systems that are **clean, scalable, and fully automated**. I love turning chaos into code.

### 🧰 My Daily Stack

- ☁️ **Infra**: Terraform, Ansible  
- 🐳 **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes  
- 🔁 **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Travis  
- 🧠 **Tools I enjoy**: ArgoCD, AWS CLI, `awk`, `sed`

---

### 🔨 Projects I Maintain

- [**STRUCT**](https://github.com/httpdss/struct) — A modern, extensible project structure generator.
- [**collectd-web**](https://github.com/httpdss/collectd-web) — A simple and effective web dashboard to visualize collectd metrics.

> I build tools to make everyday DevOps life a bit easier. If my repos help you save time or learn something — mission accomplished.

---

### ⚙️ Automation That Matters

- GitHub Actions workflow for `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` via pull requests and code review.  
- AWS discovery script in Python that scans resources and outputs reports to help reduce costs and improve security posture.

---

### 🔍 How I Approach Infra

- "Less is more" — simplicity over complexity.
- Security by default, observability from day one.
- IaC is not just a tool — it’s a mindset for collaboration, clarity, and control.

### 📚 Currently Learning

- Building my personal brand & improving tech communication  
- Exploring GitOps practices and Service Mesh architectures  
- Writing more, sharing more, helping more

---

### 🥁 Outside of Tech

- Music is my jam — I play drums and listen to **Foo Fighters** and **Nirvana** when deploying things 🎸  
- Still in love with old-school CLI tools like `awk` and `sed`  
- Always curious, always building
