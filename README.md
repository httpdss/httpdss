### 🚀 About Me

I'm a DevOps engineer with a broad background in IT — from infrastructure and development to management — but over time I realized my true passion lies in the **technical side**. That’s when I decided to double down on DevOps, automation, and infrastructure as code.

What drives me is building systems that are **clean, scalable, and fully automated**. I love turning chaos into code.
