### 🚀 About Me

I'm a DevOps engineer with a broad background in IT — from infrastructure and development to management — but over time I realized my true passion lies in the **technical side**. That’s when I decided to double down on DevOps, automation, and infrastructure as code.

What drives me is building systems that are **clean, scalable, and fully automated**. I love turning chaos into code.

### 🧰 My Daily Stack

- ☁️ **Infra**: Terraform, Ansible
- 🐳 **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes
- 🔁 **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Travis
- 🧠 **Tools I enjoy**: ArgoCD, AWS CLI, `awk`, `sed`

---

### 🔨 Projects I Maintain

- [**STRUCT**](https://github.com/httpdss/struct) — A modern, extensible project structure generator.
- [**collectd-web**](https://github.com/httpdss/collectd-web) — A simple and effective web dashboard to visualize collectd metrics.

> I build tools to make everyday DevOps life a bit easier. If my repos help you save time or learn something — mission accomplished.
